# Huffman_Coding
Huffman Coding is a data compression algorithm implemented in C. It uses binary trees and priority queues to generate variable-length prefix codes for characters based on their frequencies, minimizing storage. The project demonstrates efficient encoding and decoding, showing practical use of data structures in compression.
